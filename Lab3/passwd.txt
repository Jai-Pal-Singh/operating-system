3.a
	root owns  this (/usr/bin/passwd ) file.
	
3.b So when non root user tries to change the password by using passwd it changed his own password because
    internally passwd checks the RUID and, if it is not root, its actions will be limited to real user's password.
    RUID is the Real User ID and it never (almost) changes.
    EUID is the Effective User ID, it changes for processes (not for the user).
