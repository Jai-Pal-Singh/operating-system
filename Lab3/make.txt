	There are some ways to build the code when you have more than one makefiles in a directory. They are listed below-
	a) You can rename the makefiles sensibly like makefile.win, makefile.ni etc and use them as
	make -f makefile.win
	make -f makefile.nix
	
	b) You can have a makefile that contains-
	win: make -f makefile.win
	nix: make -f makefile.nix
	and use make win or make nix
