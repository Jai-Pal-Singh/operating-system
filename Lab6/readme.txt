Part 1;
	folder part 1 contains the changed sort function. This time i have used thread_yield() function instead of timer_sleep() function.

Part 2:
	I have completed part 2 upto graph plot. I have difficulty in creating graph for time_slice vs number of threads for fixed iterations. But I have created graph for time_slice vs number of iterations for fixed threads with some assumptions.  I have also added extra question code.
