my code works fine for cd command. It runs the started programs in foreground and background gracefully. 
There is some kind of problem with exit or control+d. For some preceding programs it runs fine and terminates the toy shell when encountered. But for some commands, we have to exit as many times the command is called.
My shell is more like ubuntu or other shell which tells you your current working directory.
I am working on making it good for pipelining also but I haven't achieved it yet!
